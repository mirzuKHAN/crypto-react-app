If Dockerfile does not work:

1) Have node.js installed (I have v20.11.1 on my machine, so that's the one I recommend for this app)
2) Open the project (in VSCode preferably)
3) Then type the following commands in the terminal:
    npm install
    npm run dev 
4) Open the localhost:(port) shown in the terminal in your browser.
